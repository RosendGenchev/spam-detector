\# Spam Detector (TF-IDF + Naive Bayes)



This project implements a simple email/SMS spam detector in Python using a

classic machine learning pipeline based on TF-IDF vectorization and

Multinomial Naive Bayes classification.



The goal of the project is to demonstrate a clean, installable Python project

with proper structure, testing, type hints, and linting.
